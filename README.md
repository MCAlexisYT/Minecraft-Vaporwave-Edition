# Minecraft Vaporwave Edition Assets
 Everything I used to create what would become the screenshot I used for a post on r/vaporwaveaesthetics, including the scrapped stuff.
 
As for the "Minecraft" and "Vaporwave Edition" text, I used a Blockbench plugin called "Minecraft Title Generator". And the button textures were based off of the "neon" textures within that plugin. The program I used is paint.net, which you can get over at https://getpaint.net, and that is why you'll see .pdn files in some places.

~~Why can't I link to external websites in README.md? You'll unfortunately have to type-in "getpaint.net" into the URL bar at the top of your browser window, or maybe bottom on mobile devices.~~ It works now ._.
